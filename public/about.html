<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Justin. I am a college student who lives in Franklin square 
  outside of college. I am majoring in computer science. I like seeing birds 
  from time to time.</p>

<p>I am a college student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I have already 
  completed a course in data structures, principles of software, and computer 
  organization. From these courses alone, I have gained experience working in 
  the following programming languages:<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
  </ul> </p>

<p>Coursework aside, I have also been in a few clubs, like the Game developer 
  club. I also have a few side projects like a game I am working on called 
  "Flying Solo to the Summit."
